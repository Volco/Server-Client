# Proxy Lock Help

>Your IP (123.456.78.910) is currently locked due to being a proxy. We automatically lock these connections since they are used to spam, hack, or otherwise attack our server. Disable any proxies you are using to connect to PS.

If you received the above message and are unable to chat, you are using a [proxy](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) or [VPN](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) connection. Here are some troubleshooting steps you can take to resolve this issue - after each step make sure to type `/logout` in any chatroom (such as Lobby) and log back in.
- Turn your proxy or VPN off.
- Make sure you are logged out on all other devices.
- If you are using the Opera, Puffin, or Brave browsers, you may have a VPN enabled by default. Try using a different browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
- iCloud Private Relay is considered a proxy connection. Please disable it if you have it enabled on your device.
- If you are using TOR, close it and open Showdown in a standard browser.
- If you are using a shared or commercial network, it may have a proxy or VPN enabled. Either wait until you can connect on your usual network or contact your system administrator.
- If you are using a school or work-issued device, it may have proxy or VPN software enabled. Use a different device or contact your system administrator.
- Type `/ip` in any chatroom. You will see your IP (it will be 4 numbers separated by periods such as `123.456.78.910`). Check your IP with a website such as [WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) or [IPLocationTools](https://www.iplocationtools.com/). If the geolocation or Internet service provider indicated is not familiar, you are using a proxy or VPN connection. If this is your home connection, you can edit your network configuration if you have the knowledge to do so. Otherwise contact your Internet service provider for assistance.

Still locked and you're completely certain that you are not on a proxy or VPN connection? File a Help Ticket on Showdown by typing `/ht` in any chatroom or directly at https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/view-help-request and global staff will assist you.
